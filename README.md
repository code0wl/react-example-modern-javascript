On the react site there is a demo on how to learn to think with react. This is the same tutorial executed using ES2015 and webpack as a build process. There are some gotcha's transforming your code to ES2015 whilst using React. In this demo there is a solution for these common challenges.

Follow the original and great tutorial here
